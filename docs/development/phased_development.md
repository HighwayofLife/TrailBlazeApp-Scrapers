# Phased Development Plan for TrailBlazeApp-Scrapers

This document outlines a phased development plan for the TrailBlazeApp-Scrapers project. This approach prioritizes building core functionalities first and gradually adding more complex features. This strategy ensures a stable foundation and allows for iterative development and testing.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

(complete)

**Phase 1 Deliverables**:

*   Basic project structure with core modules implemented.
*   Unit tests for all core modules.
*   Basic documentation for core components.

## Phase 2: Database Integration and Data Handling

(complete)

**Phase 2 Deliverables**:

*   Database integration with `DatabaseManager`.
*   Data models defined using Pydantic.
*   Data validation implemented with `DataValidator`.
*   Unit and integration tests for database interactions and data validation.
*   Documentation for database integration and data handling.

## Phase 3: Concrete Scraper Implementation (AERC Scraper)

**Focus**: Implementing the first concrete scraper for AERC events and integrating all components.

**Classes/Modules to Implement in Order**:

1.  **`app/scrapers/aerc_scraper.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Implement the `AERCScraper` class, inheriting from `BaseScraper` and implementing AERC-specific scraping logic (`scrape`, `parse_html`, helper functions for data extraction).
    *   **Why**: To start scraping data from the AERC website.
    *   **Testing**: Unit tests for all AERC scraper specific methods (`_extract_name_and_id`, `_extract_details`, etc.). Integration tests to verify the complete scraping process from HTML retrieval to data extraction and consolidation.

2.  **`app/main.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Implement the main application entry point to orchestrate the scraping process, instantiate scrapers, and manage data flow.
    *   **Why**: To create an executable script to run the scraper.
    *   **Testing**: Basic integration tests to ensure the main script runs without errors and orchestrates the scraping process.

**Phase 3 Deliverables**:

*   Implementation of the `AERCScraper`.
*   Implementation of `main.py` to run the AERC scraper.
*   Integration tests for the AERC scraper and database interaction.
*   End-to-end scraping functionality for AERC events.
*   Documentation for the AERC scraper and running the application.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Refinements

**Focus**: Adding advanced features, improving robustness, and refining existing components.

**Functionalities to Implement**:

*   **Comprehensive Metrics Validation and Display**: Enhance `display_metrics` to perform more detailed validation and provide more informative output.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Exception Management**: Implement custom exceptions and improve error handling throughout the application.
*   **Documentation and Guides**: Write comprehensive documentation, including development guides, user guides, and API documentation.
*   **Code Refactoring and Optimization**: Refactor code for better readability, maintainability, and performance.
*   **Asynchronous Scraping (Future Consideration)**: Explore and potentially implement asynchronous scraping for improved performance and scalability.
*   **Implement other scrapers (SERA, etc.)**: Add more concrete scrapers following the framework.

**Phase 4 Deliverables**:

*   Enhanced metrics and logging.
*   Improved error handling and robustness.
*   Comprehensive documentation.
*   Refactored and optimized codebase.
*   Potentially asynchronous scraping (if feasible).
*   Additional scrapers (SERA, etc.).

This phased approach allows for a structured and iterative development process, ensuring a solid foundation and manageable steps towards a fully functional multi-scraper application. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for continuous testing and validation throughout the development lifecycle.
