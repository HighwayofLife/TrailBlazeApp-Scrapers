# Phased Development Plan for TrailBlazeApp-Scrapers

This document outlines a phased development plan for the TrailBlazeApp-Scrapers project. This approach prioritizes building core functionalities first and gradually adding more complex features. This strategy ensures a stable foundation and allows for iterative development and testing.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

**Focus**: Setting up the basic project structure and implementing essential core components that will be used across all scrapers.

**Classes/Modules to Implement in Order**:

1.  **`app/config.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**:  Manage application configuration using `pydantic-settings`. Load settings from environment variables and `.env` files.
    *   **Why first**: Configuration is fundamental. It defines database settings, cache parameters, and other global settings required by other modules.
    *   **Testing**: Unit tests to verify settings are loaded correctly from environment variables and default values are used when necessary.

2.  **`app/logging_manager.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Centralized logging management using the `logging` module and `colorama` for formatted output.
    *   **Why next**: Logging is crucial for debugging and monitoring the application from the beginning.
    *   **Testing**: Unit tests to ensure different log levels work as expected and output is formatted correctly.

3.  **`app/metrics_manager.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**:  Manage metrics collection and display for tracking scraper performance and data integrity.
    *   **Why**: Metrics are important for monitoring the scraping process and validating data extraction.
    *   **Testing**: Unit tests to verify metrics are incremented and displayed correctly. Test metric validation logic.

4.  **`app/utils.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Implement utility functions like `parse_date`, `parse_time`, `extract_city_state_country`, and `generate_file_name`.
    *   **Why**: These utility functions are used by multiple modules, including scrapers and database managers.
    *   **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for each utility function, covering various input formats and edge cases.

5.  **`app/cache.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Implement caching mechanism using `cachetools.TTLCache` to avoid redundant HTML downloads.
    *   **Why**: Caching is essential for efficiency and reducing load on target websites.
    *   **Testing**: Unit tests to verify cache hits, cache misses, TTL expiration, and cache invalidation.

6.  **`app/base_scraper.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Implement the abstract `BaseScraper` class, defining the common interface and shared functionalities for all concrete scrapers (e.g., `get_html`, `_consolidate_events`, `create_final_output`, `display_metrics`).
    *   **Why**: Provides the foundation for building specific scrapers and enforces consistency.
    *   **Testing**: Unit tests for the concrete methods in `BaseScraper`. Mock abstract methods for testing purposes.

**Phase 1 Deliverables**:

*   Basic project structure with core modules implemented.
*   Unit tests for all core modules.
*   Basic documentation for core components.

## Phase 2: Database Integration and Data Handling

**Focus**: Connecting the application to the PostgreSQL database and implementing data persistence and validation.

**Classes/Modules to Implement in Order**:

1.  **`app/database.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Implement the `DatabaseManager` class to handle all database interactions (connection management, CRUD operations for events).
    *   **Why**: Database interaction is crucial for storing and managing scraped data.
    *   **Testing**: Unit tests for database connection, insert, update, delete, and query operations. Use a test database (e.g., in Docker) for integration testing. Test context manager functionality.

2.  **`app/models.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Define data models using Pydantic for data validation and schema definition (`EventDataModel`, `Distance`, `ControlJudge`).
    *   **Why**: Data models ensure data consistency and facilitate validation before database insertion.
    *   **Testing**: Unit tests to validate data models against valid and invalid data inputs.

3.  **`app/data_validator.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Implement the `DataValidator` class to validate scraped data against the Pydantic models and database constraints.
    *   **Why**: Data validation is critical for ensuring data integrity and catching errors early in the scraping process.
    *   **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for data validation, covering schema validation, existence checks, data comparison, and edge cases.

**Phase 2 Deliverables**:

*   Database integration with `DatabaseManager`.
*   Data models defined using Pydantic.
*   Data validation implemented with `DataValidator`.
*   Unit and integration tests for database interactions and data validation.
*   Documentation for database integration and data handling.

## Phase 3: Concrete Scraper Implementation (AERC Scraper)

**Focus**: Implementing the first concrete scraper for AERC events and integrating all components.

**Classes/Modules to Implement in Order**:

1.  **`app/scrapers/aerc_scraper.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Implement the `AERCScraper` class, inheriting from `BaseScraper` and implementing AERC-specific scraping logic (`scrape`, `parse_html`, helper functions for data extraction).
    *   **Why**: To start scraping data from the AERC website.
    *   **Testing**: Unit tests for all AERC scraper specific methods (`_extract_name_and_id`, `_extract_details`, etc.). Integration tests to verify the complete scraping process from HTML retrieval to data extraction and consolidation.

2.  **`app/main.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Implement the main application entry point to orchestrate the scraping process, instantiate scrapers, and manage data flow.
    *   **Why**: To create an executable script to run the scraper.
    *   **Testing**: Basic integration tests to ensure the main script runs without errors and orchestrates the scraping process.

**Phase 3 Deliverables**:

*   Implementation of the `AERCScraper`.
*   Implementation of `main.py` to run the AERC scraper.
*   Integration tests for the AERC scraper and database interaction.
*   End-to-end scraping functionality for AERC events.
*   Documentation for the AERC scraper and running the application.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Refinements

**Focus**: Adding advanced features, improving robustness, and refining existing components.

**Functionalities to Implement**:

*   **Comprehensive Metrics Validation and Display**: Enhance `display_metrics` to perform more detailed validation and provide more informative output.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Exception Management**: Implement custom exceptions and improve error handling throughout the application.
*   **Documentation and Guides**: Write comprehensive documentation, including development guides, user guides, and API documentation.
*   **Code Refactoring and Optimization**: Refactor code for better readability, maintainability, and performance.
*   **Asynchronous Scraping (Future Consideration)**: Explore and potentially implement asynchronous scraping for improved performance and scalability.
*   **Implement other scrapers (SERA, etc.)**: Add more concrete scrapers following the framework.

**Phase 4 Deliverables**:

*   Enhanced metrics and logging.
*   Improved error handling and robustness.
*   Comprehensive documentation.
*   Refactored and optimized codebase.
*   Potentially asynchronous scraping (if feasible).
*   Additional scrapers (SERA, etc.).

This phased approach allows for a structured and iterative development process, ensuring a solid foundation and manageable steps towards a fully functional multi-scraper application. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for continuous testing and validation throughout the development lifecycle.
